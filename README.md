# Automatic-Excel-Report-Updation-Using-Python
This is a project aimed at automating a portion of my workflow. The ideal outcome would be a program that downloads the updated report from the website, automatically every morning, and is then processed, cleaned and appended to an existing Excel Sheet. The excel sheet contains multiple sheets, the data must be appended to that particular sheet, with the known destination fromat.

The project is divided into two phases, phase - 1 involves the steps beginning at reading the downloaded report till appending the processed, cleaned and formatted data to the existing sheet.

Phase 2 will involve the steps preceding that.
